####By Alex Gajewski
######A repository for the purpose of tracking my progress in learning R as a tool for data analysis.

#####Week 1 - Learning Basic Data Scientist Tools
- [x] Videos 1.1-2.7
- [x] Installed R, RStudio, Git
- [x] Setup GitHub Repository
- [x] Asked for Username for Sharing
- [x] Videos 2.8-2.9
- [x] Shared GitHub Repository

#####Week 2 - R Programming for the Data Scientist
- [x] Getting Started Powerpoint

- [x] Track Learning Progress on GitHub
- [x] Fibonacci Program V2 :)
- [x] Install Affy Packages|Setup Affy Environment
- [x] Analysis of Affymetrix Microarray Data with R and Bioconductor

#####Weeks 3 and 4 - Real Project|Detection of differentially expressed genes using Affymetrix gene expression technology, from raw data to statistically significant differentially expressed genes
- [x] Raw Data QC and Filtering

######Finished in 1.4 Weeks, Difficult Work Ahead

#####Weeks 5 to 8 - Real Project
- [ ] Use machine learning methods in R to detect and validate (training and testing) a minimal gene signature able to classify the gene expression of samples in two phenotypic groups
